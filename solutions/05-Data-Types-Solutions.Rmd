```

## Your Turn 1

Use `flights` to create `delayed`, the variable that displays whether a flight was delayed (`arr_delay > 0`).

Then, remove all rows that contain an NA in `delayed`. 

Finally, create a summary table that shows:

1. How many flights were delayed  
2. What proportion of flights were delayed

```{r}
flights %>%
  mutate(delayed = arr_delay > 0) %>%
  drop_na(delayed) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(delayed), prop = mean(delayed))
```


## Your Turn 2

In your group, fill in the blanks to:

1. Isolate the last letter of every name and create a logical variable that displays whether the last letter is one of "a", "e", "i", "o", "u", or "y".  
2. Use a weighted mean to calculate the proportion of children whose name ends in a vowel (by `year` and `sex`)   
3. and then display the results as a line plot.

```{r}
babynames %>%
  mutate(last = str_sub(name, -1), 
    vowel = last %in% c("a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "y")) %>%
  group_by(year, sex) %>%
  summarise(p_vowel = weighted.mean(vowel, n)) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_line(mapping = aes(year, p_vowel, color = sex))
```

## Your Turn 3

Repeat the previous exercise, some of whose code is below, to make a sensible graph of average TV consumption by marital status.

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  drop_na(tvhours) %>%
  group_by(marital) %>%
  summarise(tvhours = mean(tvhours)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(tvhours, fct_reorder(marital, tvhours))) +
    geom_point()
```

## Your Turn 4

Do you think liberals or conservatives watch more TV?
Compute average tv hours by party ID an then plot the results.

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
   drop_na(tvhours) %>%
   group_by(partyid) %>%
   summarise(tvhours = mean(tvhours)) %>%
   ggplot(aes(tvhours, fct_reorder(partyid, tvhours))) +
     geom_point() +
     labs(y = "partyid")
```

## Your Turn 5

What is the best time of day to fly?

Use the `hour` and `minute` variables in `flights` to compute the time of day for each flight as an hms. Then use a smooth line to plot the relationship between time of day and `arr_delay`.

```{r}
flights %>% 
  mutate(time = hms(hour = hour, minute = minute)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(time, arr_delay)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + geom_smooth()
```

## Your Turn 6

Fill in the blanks to:

Extract the day of the week of each flight (as a full name) from `time_hour`. 

Calculate the average `arr_delay` by day of the week.

Plot the results as a column chart (bar chart) with `geom_col()`.

```{r}
flights %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(time_hour, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)) %>% 
  group_by(weekday) %>% 
  drop_na(arr_delay) %>% 
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(arr_delay)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_col(mapping = aes(x = weekday, y = avg_delay))
```

# Take Aways

Dplyr gives you three _general_ functions for manipulating data: `mutate()`, `summarise()`, and `group_by()`. Augment these with functions from the packages below, which focus on specific types of data.

Package   | Data Type
--------- | --------
stringr   | strings
forcats   | factors
hms       | times
lubridate | dates and times
