## Tidy and untidy data

`table1` is tidy:
```{r}
table1 
```

For example, it's easy to add a rate column with `mutate()`:
```{r}
table1 %>%
  mutate(rate = cases/population)
```

`table2` isn't tidy, the count column really contains two variables:
```{r}
table2
```

It makes it very hard to manipulate.

## Your Turn 1

Is `bp_systolic` tidy?

```{r}
bp_systolic2 
```

## Your Turn 2

Using `bp_systolic2` with `group_by()`, and `summarise()`:

* Find the average systolic blood pressure for each subject
* Find the last time each subject was measured

```{r}
bp_systolic2
```

## Your Turn 3

On a sheet of paper, draw how the cases data set would look if it had the same values grouped into three columns: **country**, **year**, **n**

## Your Turn 4

Use `gather()` to reorganize `table4a` into three columns: **country**, **year**, and **cases**.

```{r}
table4a 
```

## Your Turn 5

On a sheet of paper, draw how this data set would look if it had the same values grouped into three columns: **city**, **large**, **small**

## Your Turn 6

Use `spread()` to reorganize `table2` into four columns: **country**, **year**, **cases**, and **population**.

```{r}
table2 
```

# Take Aways

Data comes in many formats but R prefers just one: _tidy data_.

A data set is tidy if and only if:

1. Every variable is in its own column
2. Every observation is in its own row
3. Every value is in its own cell (which follows from the above)

What is a variable and an observation may depend on your immediate goal.
