## R notebooks

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

R code goes in **code chunks**, denoted by three backticks. Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Crtl+Shift+Enter* (Windows) or *Cmd+Shift+Enter* (Mac). 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert* button on the toolbar, then selecting *R* or by pressing  *Ctrl+Alt+I* (Windows) or *Cmd+Option+I* (Mac).

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* (Windows) or *Cmd+Shift+K* (Mac) to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
